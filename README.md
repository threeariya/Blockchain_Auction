## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Start Ganache Network**
   - Open Ganache (either the Ganache GUI or Ganache CLI).
   - Make sure that Ganache is running on the default settings (`127.0.0.1:7545`).
   - If using Ganache CLI, make sure itâ€™s started with the following:
     ```bash
     ganache --port 8545 --networkId 5777
     ```

2. **Open Truffle Console**
   - Navigate to your project directory in the terminal:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/project
     ```
   - Compile and Migrate the contract to truffle
     ```bash
     truffle migrate --network development
     ```
   - Run the following command to open the Truffle console:
     ```bash
     truffle console --network development
     ```

3. **Update Network (Before Running Any Tests)**
   - Every time you enter the Truffle console, it is recommended to deploy or redeploy your contracts:
     ```bash
     truffle migrate --network development
     ```

4. **Run the Tests**
   - Once the contract is deployed and the migration is complete, you can run the tests to verify that everything is working correctly:
     ```bash
     truffle test
     ```
